This is a collection of library functions which support the 
gadgets.  They were pulled from VFd, and some are extensions 
to already open-sourced software.  See the LICENSE file for 
all of the applicable licenses and references.


Dependencies
This library depends on git being installed as it clones and 
bulds a basic json parsing library (jsmn) from github.

We also depend on mk (the make uitlity origianally written
for Plan-9). It can be pulled and built as a tool from the 
Ningaui opensource repo: https://github.com/att/ningaui. The
Makefile might work; feel free to keep it up to date if you 
prefer make/gmake.

Building
To build:
	mk jsmn
	mk

Unit Tests
There are several unit tests which can be built and executed.
Each test builds a stand-alone binary which will test the 
related library module.


Caution:
The jsmn library is cloned and compiled in place; pleas do NOT 
check it into this repo.
